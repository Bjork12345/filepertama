▪ If the material is inside silo /warehouse during fire, use fron-loader, and /or crane equipment with grab to remove the burning charcoal. Remove the cargo to an area where water is available. Be sure to kill the fire in each batch of charcoal before next batch of charcoal is not open air the content of carbon monoxide in the air has to be controlled continuously as long as there may exist any risks of fire.
▪ People in the area nearby and /or people involved in the fire extinguishing have to wear artificial aid all the time as long as they may be exposed to high content of CO2-gas. 
▪ Note : CO2-gas is not visible and does not smell and could be extremly poisoned if the content in the air is too high.
▪ Fire and Explotion Risk:
Be careful with open fire /smoking, welding, etc near by charcoal as it is easy to ignite. Self heating of charcoal has been reported. Risk of self heating may be increased especially when in charcoal with high moisture content were raising temperature may be started by oxidation. In turn the oxidation may accelerate the oxidation-process in a pile of charcoal up to self-heating temperature.
